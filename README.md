# LinuxOSXremap
Remapping Linux, specifically just Ubuntu 16.04 for right now, to use OSX or Lisp style keymaps. The idea is to make all of my shortcut keys that I actually use on my OSX computers the exact same on Linux. It's a preference thing, some will like it and others won't care or understand the joys of not needing spider fingers.

This script requires python2 and python3. I have only tested this with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Note: Currently I am not checking if the keyboard shortcuts have already been populated, if you run this script multiple times you could end up with multiple shortcuts. Please open the Keyboard settings -> Shortcuts (tab) -> Custom Shortcuts to remove any duplicates until I resolve this.
